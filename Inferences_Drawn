## Comparison:

1. The sensitivity (True Positive Rate) decreased slightly from the original XGBoost model (10.05%) to the model after hyperparameter optimization (8.87%). 
This indicates that the optimized model is slightly less effective in correctly identifying positive cases (flight delays due to weather) compared to the original model.
2. The specificity (True Negative Rate) remained relatively similar between the two models, with a slight decrease from 98.91% to 98.82%. 
This means that both models are good at correctly identifying negative cases (non-delayed flights).
3. The precision increased from 71.08% to 66.57% in the optimized model. 
This suggests that the optimized model is slightly better at predicting true positive cases among all the positive predictions it makes.
4. The accuracy remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease from 80.26% to 79.94%.
5. The validation AUC decreased from 0.54 to 0.53 in the optimized model. 
A lower AUC indicates that the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative cases has decreased slightly.
